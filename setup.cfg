#[flake8]
## Explanation of errors and reasons for disabling them
## Format: ERR: Description - Explanation for disabling.
##
## E501: line too long - I just want to keep line lengths within reason.
## E251: unexpected spaces around keyword / parameter equals - I really like spaces around the parameters. I think it's easier to read.
## E265: block comment should start with '# ' - Commented out code does not have a space by convention. Comments do.
## E302: expected 2 blank lines, found 1 - This doesn't seem necessary to me. One blank line seems fine.
## W391: blank line at end of file - I prefer a blank line at the end of the file.
## E305: expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition, found X - One space afterwards looks fine to me.
## E266: too many leading '#' for block comment - Sometimes I prefer comment blocks to stand out, so I use multiple #.
## W503: line break before binary operator - I prefer a line break before the binary operator (as opposed to the opposite).
